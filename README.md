# NBA-Data-Mining-Project

This repository contains Python code and data files related to a data mining project focused on the National Basketball Association (NBA). The focus of our project is predicting potential NBA award nominees by rank with the top rank being the winner of that award.

The three distinct awards being predicted are:
1. The Most Valuable Player (MVP)
2. Defensive Player of the Year (DPOY)
3. Sixth Man of the Year (SMOY)

### Our Vision
Develop an alternative source of reference for potential award winners. Avid fans of the NBA often question the legitimacy behind award winners, so we are attempting to prove authenticity of the reults. 

### Our Mission
Create a predictive model that excludes all biases and solely relies on pure metrics to determine truly deserving players for each major award.
